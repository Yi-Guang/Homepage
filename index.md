I'm Yiguang Bai from Xidan University (XDU)ï¼Œyou can also call be Ygor. My research interests lie at Graph optimization and Complex networks (Social Computing). I love connecting with different people so if you want to say hi, I'll be happy to meet you! 

# Seminar
## Networks better the life! 
We have an online seminar [Network seminar](https://yi-guang.github.io/github.io/XD-OPTNS-Seminar) via Tencent Meeting on Friday each week! If you are interested in our work, please be free to contract me (ygbai(at)foxmail.com)!

## NEWS!
10/30 I will have a talk about *network partition and network centralities* at 6-th applied mathematical workshop at XDU.
