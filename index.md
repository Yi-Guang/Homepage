## Networks better the life! 

I'm Yiguang Bai from Xidan University (XDU)，you can also call be Ygor. My research interests lie at Graph optimization and Complex networks (Social Computing). I love connecting with different people so if you want to say hi, I'll be happy to meet you! 

### Seminar

We have an online seminar [Network seminar](https://yi-guang.github.io/github.io/XD-OPTNS-Seminar) via Tencent Meeting on Friday each week! If you are interested in our work, please be free to contract me (ygbai(at)foxmail.com)!
